Barnyard Blitz (C++ Game Development)

Barnyard Blitz is a casual C++ game developed during my university studies, showcasing fundamental game development concepts. The game challenges players to catch falling eggs using a movable slider, requiring quick reflexes and timing.

Key Features & Learning Outcomes:

Core Gameplay Loop: Implemented a continuous gameplay loop involving falling objects (various egg types) and player input (slider movement) for catching.

Collision Detection: Developed logic for detecting collisions between the falling eggs and the player's slider, triggering score updates or loss conditions.

Scoring and Lives System: Integrated a scoring mechanism for successful catches and a life system (represented by hearts), adding a challenge element to the gameplay.

Dynamic Object Spawning: Managed the spawning of different types of eggs from the top of the screen, potentially with varying speeds or values.

User Interface Elements: Designed and implemented basic UI components to display the score (caught eggs) and remaining lives.

Foundational Game Development: This project reinforced my understanding of event handling, game state management, and basic physics within a game environment using C+
